## Errno

1. Many C functions will set a global variable called
   errno to hold an error code if something went wrong.

2. ctypes has a full support for errno and the function
   get_errno() returns its value (which is the last reported error)

3. The starter tries to use fopen to create a file.
   Set a path to a valid file to see the code works.

4. Now change the destination to an invalid path to see the code fails and prints the error value.

5. Fix back to a valid file path, and use fputs() to write something to the file
