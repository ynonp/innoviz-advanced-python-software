# Python <-> C Data Types

The library ctypes defines many wrapper objects for common type
conversion between python and C.

They are conveniently named c_<type>, for example:
c_double, c_int, c_short, c_byte, c_void_p, c_char_p.

Full list is here:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#fundamental-data-types

We use `function.restype = <type>` to tell ctypes what the return
type of a function is.

We use `function.argtypes = [<type>, <type>, ...] to tell ctypes what
input arguments are expected.

1. The starter calls libc.pow twice.
   First we'll get some weird value because input and output are sent in the wrong format.
   In the second call values are sent and read correctly so correct value is printed

2. print dir(c_int()) and check what can this object do

3. Assume the following line in the program:

```
x = c_int(7)
```

   Find out how to print the 7 using "x"

4. Can you change the value of `x` after its creation?

5. Let's play with assignments to bytes arrays. Run the following code:

```
x = c_char_p(b'one')
print(x)

x.value = b'two'
print(x)
```

Did the two print() statements printed the same value? Can you explain why?

6. The functions create_string_buffer and create_unicode_buffer will create a mutable array of bytes / chars. See if you can figure out how to create and manipulate the buffer
