## Callback Functions

1. The decorator @CFUNCTYPE declares a function as a callback function

2. A callback function is called from C to python, for example:
  - If C code needs to ask python something to continue (a compare function for a sort algorithm)
  - If C code needs to report something to python (finished reading a file, got some data from network)

3. From C - the function looks like any other function pointer

4. From Python - it looks like a normal python function
