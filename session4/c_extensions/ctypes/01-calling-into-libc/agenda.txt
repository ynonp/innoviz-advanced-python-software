# CTypes

ctypes is a foreign function library for Python.
It provides C compatible data types,
and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared libraries.

It can be used to wrap these libraries in pure Python.

Our first introduction to ctypes is via the function:

ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary('...')

Which loads a DLL


------

The starter.py program reads libc on linux and saves it into a python variable. It then calls the function rand() to get a random number.

1. Run the code (if using windows, change DLL path accordingly)

2. Add the folllowing line to the end of the file: 

   ```
   print(dir(libc))
   ```

   Did the code work? What was the only function name that was printed?

3. Now let's try to call a function with arguments. You'll notice that every time we run our python code we get the same random number. Add the following call before calling rand():

   ```
   libc.srand(7)
   ```

   What happened? What will happen if you choose different numbers? If you pass floating point values? A string?
