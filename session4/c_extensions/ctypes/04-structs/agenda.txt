# Structure and Pointers

1. Many C functions expect to receive or return structures, so ctypes has built-in support for them.

2. We define a structure by creating a class inheriting Structure.

3. We'll usually pass a pointer(struct) from python to C.

4. Use POINTER(c_int) to create a Pointer-to-int type

5. Use pointer(c_int(7)) to create a pointer to a concrete value

////////////////////////////

1. Run the starter code

2. The starter code defines a new struct to hold Timeval values

3. The function localtime takes a long value that represents a timestamp (seconds since epoch) and returns the struct described here:
  https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/tm/

4. Create a python implementation of the struct

5. Call localtime from python and verify the struct holds the correct data
