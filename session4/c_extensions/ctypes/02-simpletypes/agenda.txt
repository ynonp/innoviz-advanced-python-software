# Passing primitive arguments to C

The 3 native python data types that we can pass as-is to C are:

1. None           -> Turns into NULL in C

2. b"..." (Bytes) -> Turns into const char * in C

3. int            -> Turns into int in C


/////////////////////

1. The C function mkdir creates a new directory.
   Use it to create one (name it as you want)

2. The C function rmdir deletes a directory.
   Use it to delete the directory you created

3. The C function strlen returns the size of a string.
   Use it to calculate the size of the text "hello c types"

6. The C function truncate() takes a file name and a size and
   sets the size of the file to the input size, truncating data at the end.
   Use truncate() from python to reduce a file size to 3 bytes.
   What happens if the file is not there?



4. The C function abs returns the absolute value of a number.
   Call it to find the absolute value of -5

5. The C function pow() takes a number by power of n, for example pow(2, 3) == 8. What happens if you call it from your python code?
